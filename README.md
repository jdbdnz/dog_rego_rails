# Dog Registration Sample App
### I am usually working on closed source projects for clients, so I whipped up this app to show I can Rails.

It's hosted on Heroku at http://dog-rego-rails-example.herokuapp.com
The dynos go down sometimes because it is on free tier and it is rarely accessed. If you want to look at it running and cannot or don't want to run it locally, then ping me to spin it up again.

**Scenario**
The app provides a web service to register a dog. As a member of the public you should be able to create an identity for yourself and register your dog(s) to it. It mocks up that you owe fees and that you should pay them into an obviously fake (hopefully) bank account, and bugs you to do so.

**Admin Access**
As an admin you can see all the users and their dogs, along with the dogs current registration status. You can see who owes how much money, and mark fees as paid if you've somehow received fake money into the fake bank account.
